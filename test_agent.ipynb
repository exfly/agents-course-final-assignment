      "2 Background \n",
      "The idea to create a distributed programming language \n",
      "emerged during the long experience of designing and im-\n",
      "plementing commercial-grade networking applications as \n",
      "diverse as a Distributed Database, High Availability Cluster \n",
      "Monitor, MAPI-based Email Server (via wire-level protocol \n",
      "discovery), and a Video-Conferencing Server. During that \n",
      "work, communication libraries implemented abstractions \n",
      "that hid the underlying network protocol. These abstractions \n",
      "represented interconnected servers communicating over the \n",
      "network between themselves and with clients. \n",
      "3 Three Problems \n",
      "Although the applications were quite different, they ab-\n",
      "stracted the distributed hardware and software in a similar \n",
      "way. Still, the abstractions had to be implemented each time \n",
      "anew as all systems had re-invented many of the same \n",
      "building blocks: the re-programming involved remote ob-\n",
      "jects, connections, messages, queues, jobs, replies, timeouts, \n",
      "state changes, failures, and others.  \n",
      "Because the language in hand had no first-class distrib-\n",
      "uted features, it needed help of extraneous distributed librar-\n",
      "ies. However, since the language knew nothing about the \n",
      "libraries, which offered only low level networking interface, \n",
      "the coding and debugging were difficult for programmers \n",
      "while the optimization was impossible for a translator. At \n",
      "the end, there were no time and project resources left to \n",
      "improve efficiency and reliability of the communication \n",
      "components. In summary, the following three problems \n",
      "characterized many distributed systems: \n",
      "1) Repeated re-coding of the same distributed primitives. \n",
      "2) Challenging development process due to the combina-\n",
      "tion of a programming language and extraneous library. \n",
      "3) Inefficient and unreliable distributed code. \n",
      "4 One Solution \n",
      "Those repetitive efforts had built determination to de-\n",
      "velop distributed primitives for reuse in a diverse spectrum \n",
      "of applications. To embed them in the language was a logi-\n",
      "cal choice because it offered simultaneous simplicity of \n",
      "thought and efficiency of code1. The distributed program-\n",
      "ming language has nicely solved all three problems men-\n",
      "tioned above: \n",
      "1) Since the first-class distributed language features are \n",
      "always available, there is no need to re-implement them \n",
      "for every new application. \n",
      "2) These protocol-agnostic features, being higher level \n",
      "than the library interfaces, cut the need for extraneous \n",
      "tools while simplifying development and debugging. \n",
      "3) The distributed object-oriented language architecture \n",
      "and the optimizing translator raise the efficiency, relia-\n",
      "bility, and security of the distributed code. \n",
      "The distributed elements, implemented in both the lan-\n",
      "guage translator and its runtime system, become as ubiqui-\n",
      "tous as are the local primitives like heap, stack, method, \n",
      "class, variable, and object. Therefore, one does not need \n",

      "lator, and runtime to achieve the productive software devel-\n",
      "opment combined with the efficient and reliable distributed \n",

      "5 Language Design Goals \n",
      "One of the primary goals set during the Hello design \n",
      "was its future widespread adoption by the software engi-\n",
      "neering community. Therefore, it was crucial to come up \n",
      "with a general-purpose language, avoiding the danger of \n",
      "falling into a niche of specialized languages [20]. Another \n",
      "goal was to abstract in the language the components of the \n",
      "entire network and its protocols. The abstraction level \n",
      "should be high enough to conceal the mundane intricacies \n",
      "of the rigid protocol interfaces, yet not too high to make the \n",
      "language overly specialized. In addition, distributed primi-\n",
      "tives were meant to become a crucial part of the language, \n",
      "but not its dominant part: the language core should remain \n",
      "filled with general-purpose abstractions for sequential com-\n",
      "putations, which are running on a single host.  \n",
      "Towards these goals, the lower-level distributed ab-\n",
      "stractions embedded into the language’s type system, aug-\n",
      "mented by a few imperative operations, had been invented. \n",
      "Any particular distributed semantics can now be derived \n",
      "from a combination of the Hello distributed primitives -- \n",
      "engines, hosts, queues, partitions, groups, messages, events, \n",
      "and remote references -- and their operations.  \n",
      "6 Language Design Principle \n",
      "Historically, single-host general-purpose languages ab-\n",
      "stract the computer memory, memory-stored programs, and \n",
      "CPU from the computer hardware architecture first articu-\n",
      "lated in 1945 by J. von Neumann in [21]. However, distrib-\n",
      "uted abstractions should differ from single-host abstractions \n",
      "because of the following fundamental differences between \n",
      "the single-host and distributed architectures.  \n",
      "As J. Backus explained in [1], imperative single-host \n",
      "languages are designed so that their programs reflect the \n",
      "linear structure of the von Neumann machine: variables and \n",
      "statements from the source text of a program are translated \n",
      "into data and CPU instructions stored in the contiguous \n",
      "memory of a single host. Moreover, the linear text-\n",
      "descending control flow (with occasional gotos and loops) \n",
      "in the source program corresponds to the linear address-\n",
      "ascending control flow (with occasional jumps and branch-\n",
      "es) in its translated machine code, which is stored in a single \n",
      "piece of memory at runtime.  \n",
      "However, distributed software does not run in a single \n",
      "memory piece – its components execute on different com-\n",
      "puters with separate memory units. The computers connect, \n",
      "communicate and compute in a network of any structure: \n",
      "from linear – to hierarchical -- to the full graph. Network \n",
      "topology and connections between application’s compo-\n",
      "nents often change with time. Thus, the linear text-to-\n",
      "memory mapping idea that guided design of the imperative \n",
      "single-host languages fails for distributed languages. At the \n",
      "same time, a distributed language should abstract the net-\n",
      "worked components such as computers, processes, threads, \n",
      "objects, messages, events, and code packages. It shall pro-\n",
      "vide first-class language features to manage distributed \n",
      "operations with inevitable timeouts and failures, and to hide \n",
      "the underlying networking protocol.  \n",
      "Therefore, Hello design principle was to implement the \n",
      "distributed abstractions inside the language’s type system: \n",
      "1) Hello provides several built-in classes augmented with \n",
      "a few operations and statements, organically interwo-\n",
      "ven into the language’s imperative syntax and object-\n",
      "oriented semantics. Instances of these classes represent \n",
      "hosts, runtime engines, memory partitions, and execu-\n",
      "tion queues spread out around the network; their pur-\n",
      "pose is to support first-class distributed language fea-\n",
      "tures transparently to Hello programs. At runtime, host \n",
      "instances self-organize into distributed groups, which \n",
      "graph structures reflect dynamic network connections. \n",
      "2) The instances of user-defined classes – objects – reside \n",
      "in memory partitions and engine heaps around the net-\n",
      "work referring to each other through local and remote \n",
      "references. The runtime engines, with the help of the \n",
      "translator and the instances of the built-in classes, \n",
      "transparently navigate object references. The naviga-\n",
      "tion allows Hello programs to manipulate and transfer \n",
      "data, code and control flow over the network. \n",
      "7 Hello, World! \n",
      "The following example shows how Hello first-class dis-\n",
      "tributed features and sequential core allow for a simple \n",
      "design. In addition, it demonstrates fast coding of the short \n",
      "and efficient distributed programs. This example highlights \n",
      "Hello advantages over the single-host languages C [4], C++ \n",

      "2) Runpack is a shared library built from all sources of a \n",
      "source package by Hello translator: a sourcepack abc \n",

      "{\"wiki_results\": \"<Document source=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_double_effect\\\" page=\\\"\\\"/>\\nThe principle of double effect – also known as the rule of double effect, the doctrine of double effect, often abbreviated as DDE or PDE, double-effect reasoning, or simply double effect – is a set of ethical criteria which Christian philosophers have advocated for evaluating the permissibility of acting when one's otherwise legitimate act may also cause an effect one would otherwise be obliged to avoid. The first known example of double-effect reasoning is Thomas Aquinas' treatment of homicidal self-defense, in his work Summa Theologica.\\nThis set of criteria states that, if an action has foreseeable harmful effects that are practically inseparable from the good effect, it is justifiable if the following are true:\\n\\nthe nature of the act is itself good, or at least morally neutral;\\nthe agent intends the good effect and does not intend the bad effect, either as a means to the good or as an end in itself;\\nthe good effect outweighs the bad effect in circumstances sufficiently grave to justify causing the bad effect and the agent exercises due diligence to minimize the harm.\\n\\n\\n== Intentional harm vis-à-vis side effects ==\\n\\nThe principle of double effect is based on the idea that there is a morally relevant difference between an \\\"intended\\\" consequence of an act and one that is foreseen by the actor but not calculated to achieve their motive. This distinction becomes clear when comparing different types of military actions, such as those of a tactical bomber versus a terror bomber. A tactical bomber engages in strikes on enemy military targets, knowing that some civilian casualties are a foreseen but unintended consequence. However, their intention is the military objective. In contrast, a terror bomber deliberately targets civilians to induce fear and achieve political objectives, making the harm to civilians the means to an end. While civilian casualties occur in both cases, the tactical bomber’s intention is not to cause harm, and the action itself is aimed at a legitimate military goal. Because advocates of double effect propose that consequentially similar acts can be morally different, double effect is most often criticized by consequentialists who consider the consequences of actions entirely determinative of the action's morality.\\nIn their use of the distinction between intent and foresight without intent, advocates of double effect make three arguments. First, that intent differs from foresight, even in cases in which one foresees an effect as inevitable. Second, that one can apply the distinction to specific sets of cases found in military ethics (terror bombing/strategic bombing), medical ethics (craniotomy/hysterectomy), and social ethics (euthanasia). Third, that the distinction has moral relevance, importance, or significance.\\nA common application of the principle is in the use of opioids to treat pain, but which also hasten someone’s death, when treating imminently terminal patients.\\nThe doctrine consists of four conditions that must be satisfied before an act is morally permissible:\\n\\nThe nature-of-the-act condition. The action itself must be morally good or, at the very least, morally neutral.\\nThe right-intention condition. The intention must be the achieving of only the good effect, with the bad effect being only an unintended side effect. All reasonable measures to avoid or mitigate the bad effect must be taken.\\nThe concurrence condition.  The good effect must be caused by the action at least as immediately (in terms of causality, not—necessarily—temporally) as the bad effect.  It is impermissible to attempt to bring about an indirect good with a direct evil.\\nAlso formulated as:\\nThe means-end condition. The bad effect must not be the means by which one achieves the good effect. Good ends do not justify evil means.\\nThe proportionality condition. There must be a proportionately grave reason for permitting the evil effect.\\n\\n\\n== Criticisms ==\\nWhile some consequentialists may reject the Principle, Alison McIntyre states \\n</Document>\"}\n",

      "{\"wiki_results\": \"<Document source=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas\\\" page=\\\"\\\"/>\\nThomas Aquinas  (  ə-KWY-nəs; Italian: Tommaso d'Aquino, lit. 'Thomas of Aquino'; c. 1225 – 7 March 1274) was an Italian Dominican friar and priest, the foremost Scholastic thinker, as well as one of the most influential philosophers and theologians in the Western tradition. A Doctor of the Church, he was from the county of Aquino in the Kingdom of Sicily.\\nThomas was a proponent of natural theology and the father of a school of thought (encompassing both theology and philosophy) known as Thomism. Central to his thought was the doctrine of natural law, which he argued was accessible to human reason and grounded in the very nature of human beings, providing a basis for understanding individual rights and moral duties. He argued that God is the source of the light of natural reason and the light of faith. He embraced several ideas put forward by Aristotle and attempted to synthesize Aristotelian philosophy with the principles of Christianity. Aquinas' natural law theory has been influential in shaping ideas about human liberty and the moral limits of government authority. He has been described as \\\"the most influential thinker of the medieval period\\\" and \\\"the greatest of the medieval philosopher-theologians\\\".\\nThomas's best-known works are the unfinished Summa Theologica, or Summa Theologiae (1265–1274), the Disputed Questions on Truth (1256–1259) and the Summa contra Gentiles (1259–1265). His commentaries on Christian Scripture and on Aristotle also form an important part of his body of work. He is also notable for his Eucharistic hymns, which form a part of the Church's liturgy.\\nAs a Doctor of the Church, Thomas Aquinas is considered one of the Catholic Church's greatest theologians and philosophers. He is known in Catholic theology as the Doctor Angelicus (\\\"Angelic Doctor\\\", with the title \\\"doctor\\\" meaning \\\"teacher\\\"), and the Doctor Communis (\\\"Universal Doctor\\\"). In 1999, John Paul II added a new title to these traditional ones: Doctor Humanitatis (\\\"Doctor of Humanity/Humaneness\\\").\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life (1225–1244) ===\\nThomas Aquinas was most likely born in the family castle of Roccasecca, near Aquino, controlled at that time by the Kingdom of Sicily (in present-day Lazio, Italy), c. 1225. He was born to the most powerful branch of the family, and his father, Landulf VI of Aquino, Lord of Roccasecca (ca. 1172–ca. 1240), was a man of means. As a knight in the service of Emperor Frederick II, Landulf of Aquino held the title miles. Thomas's mother, Theodora Galluccio, Countess of Teano (ca. 1200–ca. 1260), belonged to the Rossi branch of the Neapolitan Caracciolo family. Landulf's brother Sinibald was abbot of Monte Cassino, the oldest Benedictine monastery. He was the youngest of four sons and had two sisters. While the rest of the family's sons pursued military careers, the family intended for Thomas to follow his uncle into the abbacy; this would have been a normal career path for a younger son of Southern Italian nobility.\\nAt the age of five Thomas began his early education at Monte Cassino, but after the military conflict between Emperor Frederick II and Pope Gregory IX spilt into the abbey in early 1239, Landulf and Theodora had Thomas enrolled at the studium generale (university) established by Frederick in Naples. There, his teacher in arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music was Petrus de Ibernia. According to his biographer William of Tocco, Martin of Dacia was his teacher of grammar and logic. It was at this university that Thomas was presumably introduced to Aristotle, Averroes and Maimonides, all of whom would influence his theological philosophy. Peter of Ireland was teaching the recently translated works of Aristotle as commented on by the Spanish-Arabic philosopher Averroes. During his study at Naples, Thomas also came under the influence of John of St. Julian, a Dominican preacher in Naples, who was part of the active effort by the Dominican Order to recruit devout followers.\\n\\nAt the age of nineteen,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_St._Thomas_(Minnesota)\\\" page=\\\"\\\"/>\\nThe University of St. Thomas (also known as UST or simply St. Thomas) is a private Catholic research university with campuses in Saint Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. Founded in 1885 as a Catholic seminary, it is named after Thomas Aquinas, the medieval Catholic theologian and philosopher who is the patron saint of students. As of fall 2021, St. Thomas enrolled 9,347 students, making it Minnesota's largest private, nonprofit university.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nFounded in 1885 by John Ireland, archbishop of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, St. Thomas began as an all-male, Catholic seminary. In 1894, the liberal arts program became an independent college through a gift from local railroad tycoon James J. Hill, who provided funds to establish the Saint Paul Seminary apart from the college. In 1903, the College of St. Thomas established a military program on campus, and it was officially termed a military school by the U.S. War Department in 1906. Initially, the school gave out two-year diplomas in commercial and classical programs before awarding its first academic degrees in 1915. In 1922, military training became optional.\\nFrom the late 1920s through the mid-1930s, the Holy Cross Fathers, who run the University of Notre Dame, controlled the college's administration. The diocese called those priests in to help with the school's financial problems; those priests were known as a crisis intervention team of sorts for parochial schools of that time. During World War II, St. Thomas served as a training base for naval officers, which kept the school open when men who would have attended college were fighting in the war. After the war, in 1948, the college established \\\"Tom Town\\\" on the eastern end of the lower quadrant, which is currently the site to the O'Shaughnessey-Frey Library and O'Shaughnessey Education Center. Tom Town, made of 20 double-dwelling huts, consisted of white, barracks-like housing units for faculty, students, and their families. The units helped to meet housing demand after World War II.\\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, St. Thomas started two of its most notable graduate programs, education in 1950 and business administration in 1974. The school became co-educational in 1977, and although women were not allowed to enroll until then, female students from St. Catherine University (then the College of St. Catherine) often took classes at St. Thomas. Women were also present as instructors and administrators on campus, but the staff, faculty, and administration have seen a vast increase in female employment since the move to co-education. In 1990, the College of St. Thomas became the University of St. Thomas and the following year, the university opened the Minneapolis campus. In 2001, St. Thomas reinstated its School of Law at its Minneapolis campus; it had been shut down during the Great Depression. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was the speaker at the grand opening.\\n\\n\\n== Campuses ==\\n\\n\\n=== Saint Paul ===\\n\\nThe St. Paul campus is the main campus and is home to most undergraduate students. The main campus, built on a farm site once considered \\\"far removed from town\\\", is located where St. Paul's Summit Avenue meets the Mississippi River. The site was farmed by ex-Fort Snelling soldier William Finn, who received the property as a pension settlement after he accidentally shot himself in the hand while on guard duty.\\nThe western edge of the campus borders the Mississippi Gorge Regional Park. Summit Avenue, which runs through the middle of the campus, is the country's longest span of Victorian homes. This tree-lined avenue includes the Governor's Mansion, F. Scott Fitzgerald's townhome, and James J. Hill's mansion.\\n\\nIn 2005, a new apartment-style residence hall was built on an existing parking lot. McNeely Hall was also built the following year. It is a large classroom building for business that replaced the smaller building of the same name. A new residential village, more parking ramps, and general plan\\n</Document>\"}\n",
